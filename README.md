 # DEPRECATED
See updated version of the app using React Hooks here [https://github.com/Orbios/movies_list](https://github.com/Orbios/movies_list).

## Description

It features managing collection of movies with search, sorting and pagination. You can add/edit/delete movies, there is client side validation and toast messages.

It has simple setup which I ideal for quick project prototyping and does not require back-end.
